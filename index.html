						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pf.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Currently pursuing my final year B. Tech. in Instrumentation and Control with Data Science at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, based in Pune, India.</p>
								<p>The project-heavy nature of my degree has reinforced my communication, project management and team leadership skills, while also giving me the opportunity to pick up invaluable reporting and presentation skills. Completing multiple projects across so many different fields has also exposed me to multiple programming languages and analytical applications. Participating in the annual college festivals gave me field experience handling media and design for multiple teams as well. </p>
								<p>During my time in high school, I managed to explore, develop and inculcate my interests in athletics and media, leading to me representing the school at multiple inter-school and inter-state sports events, and also my role as the “go-to guy” for audio, video and image work. I was also an avid toastmaster, representing my local club at various competitions. </p>
								<p>Tinkering with computers from a young age eventually led me to become the computer enthusiast I am today. I like to spend my evenings running, playing videogames, or a combination of both. </p>
